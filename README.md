# CUSTOM-VoIP-SYSTEM-USING-ASTERISK-FRAMEWORK

The project is being built as a substitute of the PBX system and IP PBX system we use at societies, hospitals, hotels or offices. We are trying to build a system that can provide the benefits of the earlier PBX systems in the user mobile phone. People connected in the same Wi-Fi network will be able to make voice and video calls, send messages, make emergency calls, send mails to the other users who are connected to the network and in a much more organised way than that of a IP PBX or PBX system.
